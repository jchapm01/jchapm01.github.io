                <p>
                		Born and raised in Chicago, IL. Currently studying at Tufts University in Medford, MA.
                		<br/>With an intuitive sense of UX/UI design that I hope to refine in a Master's program after Tufts, I plan to combine this with my background in computer science and programming to create user-friendly experiences for any website/web-based platform.
                		<br/>In my free time, I like to do hoodrat stuff with my friends.

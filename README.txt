1. I think I've done everything correctly - all 3 files, a CSS stylesheet, my page redirects to github, and I have links to my resume and bio pages.

2. Kate Wasynczuk helped me a lot on CSS, so any similarities in layout of the stylesheet is due to her walking me through how to make rules for things in my HTML files.

3. Approx hours = 5

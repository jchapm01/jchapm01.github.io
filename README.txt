Comp20 Assignment: Portfolio
9/25/2014

1. Unfortunately I started this assignment late, and wasn't able to get a CSS file up-and-running. Everything else is there - but along with not being able to implement CSS to style my page, my resume is just a bit outdated, but I figured this was okay for purposes of learning how to use HTML5/git.

2. Didn't collab with anyone

3. Approx hours = 4
